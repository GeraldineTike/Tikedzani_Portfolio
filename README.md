## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 1. **Beyond the Surface: Predicting Pollution and Protecting Our Rivers' Future**  
At **Sand Technologies**, we developed a comprehensive platform to monitor and predict river health by addressing pollution sources such as sewage discharges, agricultural runoff, and industrial waste. By combining **predictive analytics** and **chemical monitoring**, we empowered stakeholders (water companies, environmental agencies, and local authorities) to manage rivers proactively.
