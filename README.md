Welcome to my portfolio! 

I’m Tikedzani Geraldine Vele, a passionate data scientist with experience in solving complex problems using machine learning, predictive analytics, and data science techniques. Below you will find a collection of my projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, modeling, and deploying data-driven solutions.

Projects:

1. Beyond the Surface: Predicting Pollution and Protecting Our Rivers' Future
At Sand Technologies, we developed a comprehensive platform that provides insights into river health by addressing pollution sources such as sewage discharges, agricultural runoff, and industrial waste. The platform incorporates predictive analytics and chemical monitoring to empower stakeholders such as water companies, environmental agencies, and local authorities in proactive river management.

2.Anime Recommender System
A machine learning-based recommender system designed to predict user ratings for anime titles. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and deploying the model on an interactive web app using Streamlit, we aimed to enhance user experience by automating content recommendations.

3.Analyzing CO2 Emissions in the Agri-Food Sector
In this project, we analyze and predict CO2 emissions from the agri-food sector using regression analysis. We explored emission sources such as livestock, fertilizers, and transportation, with the aim to develop sustainable strategies and assess the sector’s contribution to climate change.

4.News Article Classification Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building an automated news article classification system using NLP and machine learning techniques. We trained a model to categorize articles into topics like Business, Technology, and Entertainment, and deployed the system as an interactive web application using Streamlit to improve editorial workflows.

5. Global Deforestation Analysis
In this project, we analyzed global forest area changes from 1990 to 2021. Using spatial analysis techniques, we assessed the impact of deforestation on biodiversity and ecosystem services and provided recommendations for conservation strategies and policy interventions.

6. Contaminated River Water Parameters Analysis
As a data science consultant, I developed machine learning models to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in a heavily polluted river. The goal was to enhance water quality monitoring and inform better environmental management practices for polluted water bodies.
